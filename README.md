# About

This project is built with the following tech:

- Angular 9
- Bootstrap 4 via *ngx-bootstrap*
- HTML5
- SCSS
- TypeScript

## Get Started

The default API server address is: `http://localhost:4600`. You can modify this address by updating `src/server-config.ts`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Testing

This project doesn't have tests.

## PWA

This project has been configured as a PWA. I haven't updated the default Angular favicons intentionally for sustenance. As usual, you'll need HTTPS context to make use of this functionality.
